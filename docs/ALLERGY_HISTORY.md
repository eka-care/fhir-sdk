# Allergy History Element Documentation

## Overview
Allergy History elements document allergic reactions, intolerances, and adverse reactions to substances including medications, foods, and environmental factors. This information is critical for patient safety.

## Function
```python
builder.add_allergy_history(
    code: CodeInput,
    category: Optional[str] = None,
    clinical_status: str = "active",
    criticality: Optional[str] = None,
    reaction: Optional[str] = None,
    notes: Optional[str] = None,
    id: Optional[str] = None,
) -> AllergyIntolerance
```

## Parameters

### Required Parameters
- **code**: The allergen (substance causing the reaction)

### Optional Parameters
- **category**: Type of allergen (food, medication, environment, biologic)
- **clinical_status**: Current status of the allergy (default: "active")
- **criticality**: Severity potential (low, high)
- **reaction**: Description of the allergic reaction
- **notes**: Additional information about the allergy

```

## Best Practices
1. Use create_codeable_concept with SNOMED CT codes for allergens when available
2. Distinguish between allergies, intolerances, and side effects
3. Document specific reactions for clinical decision-making
4. Set appropriate criticality levels for risk assessment
5. Include avoidance strategies and alternative options
6. Update allergy status if reactions change over time
7. Document negative allergies (NKDA) when confirmed
8. Include drug class allergies to prevent cross-reactions

## Critical Allergy Information
Always document:
- **Specific allergen** and substance details
- **Type of reaction** and symptoms experienced
- **Severity** and criticality level
- **Alternative options** and cross-reactivity risks
- **Emergency treatment** requirements (epinephrine, etc.)

## Notes
- Allergy information is critical for medication safety
- Multiple allergies can be documented for comprehensive safety profiles
- Clinical status tracking helps manage resolved or inactive allergies
- Integration with prescribing systems helps prevent adverse reactions
- Regular review ensures allergy information stays current and accurate
