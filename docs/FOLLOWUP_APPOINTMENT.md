2. Include specific instructions for preparation or documentation needed
3. Specify whether appointment is with primary care or specialist
4. Provide clear timeframes (urgent vs routine)
5. Include contact information for scheduling
6. Document rationale for follow-up timing
7. Consider patient preferences and availability
8. Include emergency contact instructions between visits

## Common Follow-up Intervals
- **Urgent conditions**: 1-3 days
- **Acute conditions**: 1-2 weeks  
- **Medication changes**: 2-4 weeks
- **Chronic stable conditions**: 3-6 months
- **Preventive care**: 6-12 months
- **Cancer surveillance**: 3-6 months
- **Post-surgical**: 1-2 weeks initially
