# Family History Element Documentation

## Overview
Family History elements document medical conditions and health information about the patient's family members. This information helps assess genetic risk factors and guide preventive care decisions.

## Function
```python
builder.add_family_history(
    condition: CodeInput,
    relation: Union[str, tuple],
    onset: Optional[Union[str, int]] = None,
    status: str = "completed",
    notes: Optional[str] = None,
    deceased: Optional[bool] = None,
    id: Optional[str] = None,
) -> FamilyMemberHistory
```

## Parameters

### Required Parameters
- **condition**: The medical condition or health problem
- **relation**: Family relationship (father, mother, brother, etc.)

### Optional Parameters
- **onset**: When the condition started (age or year)
- **status**: Status of the family history record (default: "completed")
- **notes**: Additional information about the condition or family member
- **deceased**: Whether the family member is deceased
- **id**: Custom resource ID

## Basic Usage

### Simple Family History (Preferred with CodeableConcept)
```python
from fhir_sdk import FHIRDocumentBuilder
from fhir_sdk.types import create_codeable_concept

builder = FHIRDocumentBuilder()
builder.add_patient(name="John Doe", age=30)

# Add family history
family_history = builder.add_family_history(
    condition=create_codeable_concept(
        text="Hypertension",
        code="38341003",
        system="http://snomed.info/sct",
        display="Hypertension"
    ),
    relation="Father"
)
```

### Using String (Alternative)
```python
family_history = builder.add_family_history(
    condition="Hypertension",
    relation="Father"
)
```

### With Onset and Additional Details
```python
family_history = builder.add_family_history(
    condition=create_codeable_concept(
        text="Type 2 diabetes mellitus",
        code="44054006",
        system="http://snomed.info/sct"
    ),
    relation="Mother",
    onset=55,  # Age at onset
    deceased=True,
    notes="Diagnosed at age 55, complications included neuropathy"
)
```

## Family Relationships

    condition="Heart problems", 
    relation="Grandfather",
    notes="Patient recalls heart issues but doesn't know specifics"
)
```

## Best Practices
1. Use create_codeable_concept with SNOMED CT codes for standardized conditions
2. Document both positive and negative family history
3. Include age at onset when known for risk assessment
4. Note deceased status and cause of death when relevant
5. Record multiple conditions per family member separately
6. Include approximate onset even if exact age unknown
7. Document adoption or unknown family history situations
8. Update family history as new information becomes available

## Common Medical Conditions for Family History
- **Cardiovascular**: Heart disease, hypertension, stroke
- **Cancer**: Breast, colon, prostate, lung, ovarian
- **Metabolic**: Diabetes, thyroid disease, obesity
- **Neurological**: Dementia, Parkinson's, epilepsy
- **Mental Health**: Depression, bipolar, anxiety, substance abuse
- **Other**: Asthma, arthritis, kidney disease, bleeding disorders

## Notes
- Family history helps assess genetic and familial risk factors
- Information guides screening recommendations and preventive care
- Multiple family members can have the same condition
- Onset timing helps estimate age-related risks
- Regular updates capture new diagnoses in family members
- Documentation supports genetic counseling referrals when appropriate
