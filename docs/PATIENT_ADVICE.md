## Best Practices
1. Use clear, actionable language that patients can understand
2. Organize advice by category for easier patient comprehension
3. Include specific measurements and timeframes when applicable
4. Provide both positive actions (do this) and restrictions (avoid this)
5. Include emergency contact information and warning signs
6. Tailor advice to patient's specific condition and circumstances
7. Use teach-back methods to ensure patient understanding
8. Document advice in patient-friendly language
