# Clinical Notes Element Documentation

## Overview
Clinical Notes elements document clinical observations, assessments, plans, and other healthcare provider communications. These create FHIR Communication resources for structured clinical documentation.

## Function
```python
builder.add_notes(
    note: str,
    category: Optional[str] = None,
    id: Optional[str] = None,
) -> Communication

## Parameters

### Required Parameters
- **note**: The clinical note text

### Optional Parameters
- **category**: Type or category of clinical note

## Best Practices
1. Use clear, professional language appropriate for medical records
2. Document objectively with specific details and measurements
3. Include both normal and abnormal findings
4. Organize notes logically (chronological, by body system, by problem)
5. Use appropriate medical terminology and abbreviations
6. Include decision-making rationale for treatment changes
7. Document patient education and understanding
8. Note care coordination with other providers

## Note Categories
Common categories include:
- `"history-note"` - Patient history and background
- `"examination-note"` - Physical examination findings
- `"assessment-note"` - Clinical assessment and diagnosis
- `"plan-note"` - Treatment and management plans
- `"progress-note"` - Progress updates and status changes
- `"prescription-note"` - Medication-related documentation
- `"procedure-note"` - Procedure descriptions and outcomes
- `"discharge-note"` - Discharge summaries and instructions
- `"consultation-note"` - Specialist consultation findings

## Notes
- Clinical notes create Communication resources for provider documentation
- Multiple notes can be added for different aspects of care
- Categories help organize notes by purpose and content type
- Notes support clinical decision-making and continuity of care
- Proper documentation meets regulatory and quality requirements
